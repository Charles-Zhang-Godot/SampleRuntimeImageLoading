# Sample - Runtime Image Loading

This demo examines loading image from runtime from different sources:
1. Local file
2. Network file (http/https)
3. WebSocket binary stream
4. WebSocket text stream

The image type can be anything that Godot supports (at runtime): png, jpg, svg, ktx, webp, exr/tga.

## Reference

Only a single documentation page is needed as Godot supports such dynamic contents very well: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/runtime_file_loading_and_saving.html
